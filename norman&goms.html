            <h2>Don Norman & Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Don Norman’s work in HCI emphasizes understanding the user’s interaction cycle with systems, focusing on
                how
                people plan, act, and interpret feedback. His theory is often illustrated through the
                execution–evaluation
                cycle, which divides interaction into two stages:
                Execution: The user forms a goal, decides on actions, and performs them.
                Evaluation: The user perceives the system’s response, interprets it, and evaluates if the goal is
                achieved.
            </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Connection with Evaluation Techniques in HCI</h3>
                <p>Norman’s theory links directly to usability evaluation methods discussed in (Dix et al.,
                    Human–Computer Interaction, Ch. 9)</p>

                <h4>Observation and Post-Task Walkthroughs:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Observing users shows what actions were taken, but not always why.</li>
                    <li>A post-task walkthrough lets participants reflect on their actions, providing insight into
                        goals,
                        intentions, and alternative strategies.</li>
                    <li>This aligns with Norman’s evaluation stage — understanding user interpretation and thought
                        processes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Query Techniques (Interviews & Questionnaires):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interviews and questionnaires capture user feedback about the system’s usability, helping
                        evaluators
                        understand users’ mental models and satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>They complement observations and walkthroughs, filling gaps in understanding why users acted in
                        certain ways, linking to Norman’s theory of evaluation and interpretation.</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>DRUM System Example:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tools like DRUM provide video annotation, tagging, and analytic metrics for usability studies.
                    </li>
                    <li>They help systematically collect and analyze data on user performance and cognitive workload —
                        supporting Norman’s approach to understanding how users interact with systems.</li>

                <h3>Example: Withdrawing Cash from an ATM</h3>
                <p>Seven Stages of Action</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Forming the Goal:</strong> I want to withdraw cash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forming the Intention Decide:</strong> I will use my debit card at the ATM to get money.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Specifying the Action Plan:</strong> Insert card → enter PIN → select “Withdraw Cash” →
                        choose amount → collect cash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Executing the Action Do it:</strong> Insert card, type PIN, select options, press
                        confirm.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Perceiving the State of the World Notice:</strong> Screen shows confirmation, cash comes
                        out, card returned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpreting the Perception Understand:</strong> Did the ATM dispense the correct
                        amount?
                        Did my balance update?</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluating the Outcome Check:</strong> Do I have the cash? Is the transaction
                        successful? if
                        yes → goal achieved,if no → maybe reattempt or call bank.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Gulf of execution:</strong> Confusion if the screen menu isn’t clear or buttons are hard to
                    read,
                    <strong>Gulf of evaluation:</strong> Uncertainty if the ATM doesn’t clearly indicate success (e.g.,
                    no
                    receipt or unclear message).

            <h2>GOMS</h2>
            <p>The GOMS model, proposed by Card, Moran and Newell, is a cognitive model used to describe how expert
                users
                perform routine tasks. It focuses on structured task execution and is mainly used to analyze expert,
                error-free performance.GOMS is an acronym for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong>Goals represent what the user wants to achieve. In GOMS, goals act as memory
                    points that guide the user and help recover from errors.
                    Goals are organized hierarchically from high-level tasks to smaller subgoals.</li>
                <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Operators are the lowest-level actions required to complete a task.
                    They may be physical actions (pressing a key, moving a mouse)
                    or mental actions (reading a message).
                    Operators form the basic building blocks of interaction. </li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Methods describe different ways to accomplish the same goal.
                    For example, a window can be closed by clicking a menu option
                    or pressing a shortcut key. Each method consists of a sequence of operators.</li>
                <li><strong>Selection Rules:</strong> When multiple methods exist, selection rules determine which one
                    is used.
                    The choice depends on the user, system state, and task context.
                    These rules allow GOMS to predict user behavior rather than treating it as random.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Types of GOMS Models</h3>
                <p>The GOMS framework has several variations, each suited to different analysis goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Original GOMS (Card et al., 1983):</strong>
                        Focused on expert user behavior. Assumes the user knows correct methods; mental preparation is
                        included
                        as M operators in KLM.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>CMN-GOMS (Card, Moran, Newell):</strong>
                        Combines task decomposition with operator-level timing. KLM can calculate predicted execution
                        time
                        for
                        tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM):</strong>
                        A subset of GOMS. Focuses on execution times of low-level actions without high-level goal
                        analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>NGOMSL (Natural GOMS Language):</strong>
                        Developed by Kieras. Structured, procedural representation for automated analysis. Supports
                        hierarchical
                        decomposition of goals into subgoals and methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>CPM-GOMS (Cognitive Perceptual Motor):</strong>
                        Accounts for parallel execution of cognitive, perceptual, and motor activities. Useful for
                        modeling
                        highly skilled expert behavior.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Design Focus: Real-World Impact</h3>
                <p>A GOMS-style analysis was used by NYNEX (US telephone company) before installing a new operator
                    support
                    system.The analysis showed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The new system would slow down call processing</li>
                    <li>The system was abandoned</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This saved millions of dollars.This example shows how <strong>GOMS</strong> can support design
                    decisions
                    before implementation.(Dix et al., Ch. 12, p. 424)</p>
